    <h2> Why use SVGMagic? </h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Integrates with native IDE components</strong>
            <p>
                Once installed, any SVG image can be displayed using the native IDE components just as with the bitmap-based formats (.bmp, png,
                .jpg,…). All components using TGraphic support SVGs, among which: TImage, TPicture, TCanvas.
                <img class="d-block mx-auto" src="images/timage-default.png" alt="TImage loading SVG">
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Superior image quality</strong>
            Always get the best image quality whatever the dimensions / resolution.
            You don’t need to edit the image if it needs to be resized.
            <div class="d-block mx-auto">
                <div style="text-align: center">
                    <img src="images/tiger-small.png" alt="tiger small">
                    <img src="images/tiger-large.png" alt="tiger large">
                </div>
                <div style="text-align: center">
                    <a style="width: 100%" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ghostscript_Tiger.svg">Tiger credits.</a>
                </div>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li><strong>High DPI aware</strong>
            <p>
                When an SVG is used to display an image, its quality does not change, even
                when the image is stretched. This feature offers a certain advantage when the application has to support the
                high dpi, because the resizing of the images naturally accompanies the interface.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Transparent</strong>
            <p>
                SVGs fully support transparency. No more anti-aliasing issues experienced with bitmap based images.
                <img class="d-block mx-auto gradient_bg" src="images/walking-human.svg" alt="walking human">
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Animated</strong>
            The SVG standard natively supports complex animations and SVGMagic fully supports them.
            <div class="d-block mx-auto" style="text-align: center">
                <img class="d-inline-block mx-auto" src="images/beer.svg" alt="a good glass of beer">
                <img class="d-inline-block mx-auto" src="images/animated-graphs.svg" alt="animated graphs">
            </div>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Smaller size</strong>
            <p>
                SVGs are incredibly smaller than bitmap based images, even when compressed.
                Furthermore SVGs also support compression.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Widely available</strong>
            <p>
                SVGs are widely used for internet graphics, and several well known and powerful creation tools are available,
                like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inkscape">Inkscape</a> or Adobe® Illustrator.
                In addition, you don’t need to create SVGs yourself as there are plenty of vector image libraries available online
                such as <a href="https://www.svgrepo.com/">SVG Repo</a>, <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/">Flaticon</a> and many others.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Expandable</strong>
            <p>
                SVGs can easily be expanded to other components such as buttons, checkboxes, radiobuttons, popupmenus and many more.
            </p>
            <div class="d-block mx-auto" style="text-align: center">
                <img src="images/tbutton.png" alt="TButton using SVG">
                <img src="images/timagebutton.png" alt="TImagebutton using SVG">
                <img src="images/tpopupmenu.png" alt="TPopupMenu using SVG">
            </div>
            <img class="d-block mx-auto" src="images/tcheckbox.png" alt="TCheckBox and TRadioButton using SVG">
        </li>
        <li><strong>Proven track record</strong>
            <p>
                SVGMagic is used on a daily base in commercial software like <a href="https://www.copytrans.net/">CopyTrans</a>.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Flexible</strong>
            <p>
                The SVG standard allows to obtain spectacular effects including animations, then to change them completely without modifying one line of code.

</section>
<section id="examples">
    <h2> Examples </h2>
    <p>There are two ways to use the SVG graphic component. You can either use it natively, through the VCL TImage
        component. In this case, simply put a TImage on your form, then open the Picture property to load a file, and select
        the SVG file to open as any other image.</p>
    <p>Or you can use it in your code exactly the same way as any TGraphic descendents, like a TPngImage or a TJpgImage. For
        example, here is a sample code that illustrates how to paint a SVG onto a canvas:</p>

<h2> Frequently Asked Questions </h2>

<h3> General considerations </h3>

<div class="card mb-2">
    <div class="card-header">
        Is SVGMagic compatible with FireMonkey?
    </div>
    <div class="card-body pb-0">
        <p> No. SVGMagic only targets the VCL. </p>

<div class="card mb-2">
    <div class="card-header">
        Is SVGMagic available for compiler versions earlier than XE2?
    </div>
    <div class="card-body pb-0">
        <p> No. However the whole library source code is provided with the purchase of a Small Team license ($299), and compile it with an earlier compiler may be
        tried. But be aware that we no guarantee that this will be succesfully possible, and the following points should be considered before taking a such decision :
        <ul>
            <li> Generic types are used, and the System.Generics.Collections unit is included in at least 19 files. </li>
            <li> Anonymous functions are used, at least one time for a smart pointer class, which is declared this way:<br>
            <pre><code>IWSmartPointer&lt;T&gt; = reference to function: T; </code></pre></li>
            <li> The RTTI is also used, as well as generic containers (e.g. TList&lt;T&gt; or TObjectList&lt;T&gt;) and we wrote several classes independent of data type, e.g. a class to provide generic numbers, which uses instructions like:
                <pre><code>
TWGenericNumber&lt;T&gt; = record
...
class operator TWGenericNumber&lt;T&gt;.Add(a, b: TWGenericNumber&lt;T&gt;):
TWGenericNumber&lt;T&gt;;
var
left, right, resVal: TValue;
begin
...
left := TValue.From&lt;T&gt;(a.Value);
right := TValue.From&lt;T&gt;(b.Value);
...
case (left.Kind) of
tkInteger,
tkInt64:
...
resVal := left.AsInt64 + right.AsInt64;
...
tkFloat:
...
resVal := left.AsExtended + right.AsExtended;
...
...
end;
...
Result.Value := resVal.AsType&lt;T&gt;;
end;
                </code></pre>

<h3> Installation issues </h3>

<div class="card mb-2">
    <div class="card-header">
        I installed SVGMagic but it doesn't work. I get the following error message :
    </div>
    <div class="card-body pb-0">
        <img src="images/installation-error.png" class="d-block mx-auto" alt="SVGMagic installation error">
        <p> The most likely causes for this issue are: </p>
        <ul>
            <li> You unpacked the SVG Magic package inside an incorrect folder, like e.g. the C:\Users\Public\Documents\Embarcadero\Studio\[Installed version]\
            folder instead of the C:\Users\Public\Documents\Embarcadero\Studio\ one. </li>
            <li> You have changed the BDSCOMMONDIR path in your environment variables to point to another folder.
            To solve it, please apply the following procedure:
                <ol>
                    <li> Open your IDE, and under Component->Install packages... select your installed package, then click on Remove. </li>
                    <li> Close your IDE and delete all the files you previously installed from your SVGMagic package. </li>
                    <li> Open the folder matching with your BDSCOMMONDIR environment variable, by default it's the<br>
                    C:\Users\Public\Documents\Embarcadero\Studio\ folder.<br>
                    <b>NOTE</b> If you're unsure about that path, you may open Tools->Options... in your IDE, then under Environment Options->Environment variables, check if the BDSCOMMONDIR has an override, and if yes on which path it's pointing to. </li>
                    <li> Unpack the SVGMagic package in a temporary folder. </li>
                    <li> Copy the content of the folder matching with your installed RAD Studio version number from the temporary dir in which you just unpacked the zip file to the folder pointed by your BDSCOMMONDIR.<br>
                    <b>NOTE</b> If you're in the right folder, you should see at least the following sub-folders: Bpl, Dcp and Hpp. </li>
                    <li> While copying the files, you may receive messages asking if you accept to merge folders, accept them (click yes). </li>
                    <li> Follow again the point nb 2 in the Readme.txt file. This should resolve your issue. </li>
                </ol>

<h3> Compilation issues </h3>

<div class="card mb-2">
    <div class="card-header">
        A “Xml.VerySimple.pas” file is missing and prevents me to compile the library. Where can I find it?
    </div>
    <div class="card-body pb-0">
        <p> The VerySimpleXml library is a third party library required to compile the SVGMagic source code. It is linked as a submodule to the main repository. For that reason you need to initialize and/or update your local copy using one or several of the following Git commands:

        <pre><code>
# initialize the submodules to get from the repository in the local copy
git submodule init

# get a working copy of the submodules in the local dir, and/or update them
# NOTE must be executed after a submodule init
git submodule update

# initialize and update the submodules in the local dir (same as the 2 commands above)
# NOTE if the recursive option is added, all the children submodules will also be included
git submodule update --init (--recursive)

# pull all changes in the repo including changes in the submodules
git pull --recurse-submodules

# pull all changes for the submodules
git submodule update –remote

<div class="card mb-2">
    <div class="card-header">
        Why I get a "F1026 File not found UTWSVGGraphic.dcu" error (or any error saying that a .dcu file is missing) when I try to compile my first project using SVGMagic? Why this error didn't happen when I tested the demo projects?
    </div>
    <div class="card-body pb-0">
        <p> This error happens because the compiler needs to know the path where the compiled .dcu files belonging to the SVGMagic library are located. It's why you have to define them in order to compile your project.<br>
            <br>
            The reason why the demo projects can be compiled and are working directly is because this path was already defined and is pointing to the path where the library is installed by default, as you can see if you open the project properties, under <i>Delphi Compiler -> Search Path</i>.<br>
            <br>
            <b>NOTE</b> the Target field must be set to <i>All configurations - 32-bit Windows platform</i> or <i>All configurations - 64-bit Windows platform</i> in order to show the path. </p>

        My animations are flickering. What's happening?
    </div>
    <div class="card-body pb-0">
        <p> Such issues may come from the component used in the background. The most classic case is e.g. if a TPanel is set as a background for the animated image, and its ParentBackground property is configured to True, while its DoubleBuffered property is set to False. Inverting these properties should remove the flickering. This issue may also happen if the image is put directly above a tab control. In this case, introducing a TPanel between the tab control and the image may resolve it. </p>

    <div class="card-header">
        How may the content of a SVG image be modified dynamically, e.g. changing the background color of a particular item in runtime?
    </div>
    <div class="card-body pb-0">
        <p> SVGMagic doesn't provide such functionality. However the SVG content is accessible at any time and may be modified dynamically before being read by the graphic component. You just need to write the code modifying the content.
        </p>
    </div>

<div class="card mb-2">
    <div class="card-header">
        Can a SVG be read partially?
    </div>
    <div class="card-body pb-0">
        <p> No. However, as mentioned previously, the SVG content is accessible at any time, and you may write the code required to select and extract the part of the SVG you want to draw. </p>

        Is it possible to create a TBitmap directly from a TWSVGGraphic?
    </div>
    <div class="card-body pb-0">
        <p> Yes. Below is a sample code showing how to do that: </p>
        <pre><code>
pBitmap := TBitmap.Create;
pBitmap.SetSize(pSvgGraphic.Width, pSvgGraphic.Height);

        Is it possible to create a PNG image (TPngImage) from a TWSVGGraphic?
    </div>
    <div class="card-body pb-0">
        <p> Yes. You may use e.g. the following function: </p>
        <pre><code>
function SvgToPng(pSvgGraphic: TWSvgGraphic): TPngImage;
const
    colorKey = $010101;
var
    pBitmap: TBitmap;
    rect:    TRect;
begin
    if (not Assigned(pSvgGraphic)) then
        Exit(nil);

    // create a RGBA bitmap compatible with SVG to convert
    pBitmap                  := TBitmap.Create;
    pBitmap.PixelFormat      := pf32bit;
    pBitmap.AlphaFormat      := afDefined;
    pBitmap.Transparent      := True;
    pBitmap.TransparentColor := colorKey;
    pBitmap.SetSize(pSvgGraphic.Width, pSvgGraphic.Height);

    // create a rect matching the svg size
    rect.Left   := 0;
    rect.Top    := 0;
    rect.Right  := pSvgGraphic.Width;
    rect.Bottom := pSvgGraphic.Height;

    // clear bitmap canvas
    pBitmap.Canvas.Brush.Color := colorKey;
    pBitmap.Canvas.Brush.Style := bsSolid;
    pBitmap.Canvas.FillRect(rect);

    // convert svg to transparent RGBA bitmap
    pBitmap.Canvas.Draw(0, 0, pSvgGraphic);

    // now convert bitmap to png
    Result := TPngImage.Create;
    Result.Assign(pBitmap);

    pBitmap.Free;
end;
        </code></pre>
        <p> You can then use it in the following manner: </p>
        <pre><code>
pSvgImage := TWSvgGraphic.Create;
pSvgImage.LoadFromFile('C:\Projects\Images\Tiger.svg');

pPngImage := SvgToPng(pSvgImage);

if (Assigned(pPngImage)) then
    pPngImage.SaveToFile('C:\Projects\Images\Tiger.png');

pSvgImage.Free;
pPngImage.Free;
        </code></pre>
        <p> <b>NOTE</b> the above function supports the transparency, and the color key may be adapted depending on the SVG images you need to convert. But normally the default color key should work with the majority of SVG images to convert. </p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="card mb-2">
    <div class="card-header">
        The SVG files seem to have an inherent size! But shouldn't SVGs be scalable by definition? So how can the resulting Bitmaps be scaled to a uniform (proportional) size without quality loss?
    </div>
    <div class="card-body pb-0">
        <p> The SVG files are resizable without loss of quality. The inherent size provided by the graphic is the one defined in the file itself (e.g. by the width and height properties, and/or viewBox property). But contrary to the other graphic formats, the width and height of a TWSVGGraphic component may be changed after the image was loaded, without clearing its content. For that reason the code below is valid: </p>

        <pre><code>
pGraphic := TWSVGGraphic.Create;
pGraphic.LoadFromFile('W:\SVGParser\trunk\Demo\cursor-selected.svg');
pGraphic.SetSize(512, 512);
        </code></pre>

        <b>NOTE</b> the TWSVGImageList behaves the same way, and their size may be
        changed dynamically without losing their content, for the same reasons.
        A more standard solution may also be preferred, e.g. if a generic source code
        compatible with all graphic formats should be created, by using the
        StretchDraw() function instead of Draw(). Below is an example:

        <pre><code>
pGraphic := TWSVGGraphic.Create;
pGraphic.LoadFromFile('C:\cursor-selected.svg');
rect := TRect.Create(0, 0, 512, 512);
pBitmap := TBitmap.Create;
pBitmap.SetSize(rect.Width, rect.Height);
pBitmap.Canvas.StretchDraw(rect, pGraphic);
pBitmap.SaveToFile('c:\cursor-selected.bmp');
pBitmap.Free;
pGraphic.Free;
        </code></pre>

        In case proportional thumbnails are required, the code may be modified as follows:

        <pre><code>
...
pGraphic.LoadFromFile('C:\cursor-selected.svg');
W := pGraphic.Width;
H := pGraphic.Height;
pGraphic.SetSize((W * 512) div H, 512);
pBitmap.SetSize(pGraphic.Width, pGraphic.Height);
pBitmap.Canvas.Draw(0, 0, pGraphic);
...
        </code></pre>

<h3> About SMIL animations and third-party SVG creators </h3>

<div class="card mb-2">
    <div class="card-header">
        Can SVGMagic read CSS animations?
    </div>
    <div class="card-body pb-0">
        <p> No. Only the SMIL based animations which are part of the SVG standards, are supported. All the other script languages are not supported by SVGMagic. </p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="card mb-2">
    <div class="card-header">
        Does SVGMagic support the animated SVG exported by third-party creation tools?
    </div>
    <div class="card-body pb-0">
        <p> It depends on the exporter. If the SMIL based animations are supported by the exporter, SVGMagic will be able to draw and animate the resulting SVG.
        On the other hand, if the SVG contains CSS, or any other script language, after the export, it will not be the case. </p>

    <h2> The story behind SVGMagic </h2>
    <p><strong>SVGMagic</strong> was designed for our own project needs. With around 50’000 line of Delphi code, and after
        more than 2 years of intensive work, <strong>SVGMagic</strong> significantly shortens our development time and
        allows our applications to provide a cleaner user experience. It’s the reason why applications like the CopyTrans
        are using it.</p>

    <h2> What is SVG? </h2>
    <p>According to Wikipedia:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">Scalable Vector Graphics</a> (SVG) is an
            XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation. The SVG
            specification is an open standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) since 1999.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>SVG is a graphic standard based on vectorial rendering, that allows to draw images without <strong>loss of
        quality</strong>, <strong>regardless of the size and resolution</strong>, and with considerably <strong>smaller
        image file size</strong>. The format is widely used for graphics on the internet and all recent browsers support it.
        In addition SVGs <strong> natively support animations</strong>.</p>
